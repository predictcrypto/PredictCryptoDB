# Development Roadmap

## Data Sources

### February 1, 2020
By this date I will have added the following web scrapers:

1. New web scraper for: [cryptofinance.ai/](https://cryptofinance.ai/)

    - Remember to pay for the $10 monthly subscription to be able to pull data from CMC without paying for their Pro API which is crazy expensive
    
    
2. New web scraper for: [stocktwits.com/symbol/BTC](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/BTC)

    - Extract sentiment scores and change
    
    
3. New web scraper to iterate through list of cryptocurrencies, e.g.: [www.marketwatch.com/investing/cryptocurrency/btcusd](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/cryptocurrency/btcusd

    - Extract Flipside ratings and change
    

4. New web scraper to extract news articles to start doing more semantic analysis oriented work: [www.thestreet.com/investing/cryptocurrency](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/cryptocurrency)


5. Another new web scraper to extract news articles: [www.marketwatch.com/investing/cryptocurrency](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/cryptocurrency)


### March 1, 2020
By this date I will have finalized the new process in Alteryx to run the `v3` version of the XGBoost models.


### March 15, 2020
By March 15th, the new `v3` version of the models will be executing trades on the cryptocurrency markets in an automated fashion.



## Tutorials

### January 25, 2020
By this date I will make available the first set of programming tutorials on [PredictCrypto.com](https://www.predictcrypto.com/tutorials). These will comprise of:

1. A tutorial on the basics of R. Not crypto oriented but still uses live crypto data.

2. An interactive presentation where the user gets to make selections (like what cryptocurrency to analyze) and based on those selections gets relevant practice problems relating to the content found in the first tutorial about the basics of R.

3. A slightly more advanced (intermediate level) tutorial in R. This tutorial however will take a different approach than the first one and will walk through making predictions on the cryptocurrency markets from start to finish. This tutorial uses the last 7 days of data from whenever the tutorial is launched.

4. Another interactive presentation similar to #2 from earlier, but this time giving practice problems for the more advanced R tutorial.


### April 1-April 25, 2020
This is the only thing that is not related to cryptocurrencies that I am adding to the roadmap ahead. On April 1st 2020 the US will undergo its census, which only happens once every 10 years and will provide one of the best datasets in the world for free. Therefore from April 1st to around the 25th I will plan to **only** be working on creating interactive ways to analyze the census data as well as tutorials associated with the dataset.


### June 1, 2020
Around this date I plan on expanding the technologies taught through the tutorials made available on [PredictCrypto.com](https://www.predictcrypto.com/tutorials) to also include Python, and ideally some Javascript as well.


### August 1, 2020
Around this date ideally I have started working on creating my own blockchain from scratch and have started to work on tutorials that teach about blockchain.
