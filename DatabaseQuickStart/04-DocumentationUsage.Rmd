# Documentation Usage

Everything you have visibility to within the Metabase environment is documented. Meaning, every table you see has a description which includes the URL of where the data is collected (as well as the web scraping methodology where informative), and every field within those tables has also been documented on [predictcryptodb.com](https://predictcryptodb.com). That being said, I think Metabase could do a better job at making that information readily available when it's needed, so hopefully this guide can provide some clarity where Metabase might be lacking.
